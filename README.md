# Assignment :
Pick your hometown or a city you are familiar with, and create a schematic map. You can find the slides from [the refrence here](https://speakerdeck.com/rasagy/designing-schematic-maps).

The audience can be tourists (general, or specific types of attractions like pilgrimage, lakes, etc.), or a specific use case (such as cycling, educational institutes, etc.).

You can follow the following steps for your schematic map:

* Scale, Audience & Purpose
* Mental model sketch
* Tracing relevant aspects from OSM
* Abstraction: Grids & geometric shapes
* Simplification Vs Minimal
* Elements of the city
* Visual hierarchy
* Details: Icons, Typography, Legend, Context
You can see some of the previous [schematic map exercises](https://github.com/mapschool/course/issues?q=label%3A%22Schematic+Map%22+is%3Aclosed) for reference.

# Solution :
# Schematic_Map-Data-Visualization
 An assignment from the course Data Visualization. The assignment is made using Figma.

## Location : 
#### [Indian Institute Of Technology Madras](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Indian+Institute+Of+Technology,+Chennai,+Tamil+Nadu/@12.9947793,80.2229251,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3a526781f3ce0c6b:0x41368df84c6db350!8m2!3d12.9915639!4d80.2336857!16s%2Fg%2F12j6gq6n3?authuser=0&entry=ttu)

## Audience
On-Campus and Online Degree Students, visitors, and faculty members who want to navigate through the campus easily.

## Purpose
The purpose of the  schematic map is to guide the audience. With the help of this map anyone new inside the campus can easily get to know about the campus and will get an overview about what are things to explore here. The landmarks will give them a clear visual representation to navigate through out this area.

## Mental Model Sketch

For a general understanding of the campus layout, a rough mental model was drawn.
